Project Overview:
This is a simple **console-based To-Do List Manager** built in Python.  
It allows users to add, view, and mark tasks as done.  
All operations are logged to a local file (`app.log`), and the app illustrates
the use of **modular functions**, **file handling**, and **basic logging**.
